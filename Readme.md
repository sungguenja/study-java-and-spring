what is 'public static void main(String[] args)'?

**'public' is Access Modifier.**  there are 4 Access Modifier. private, default, protected, public

1. private

   private can be touched by there class. all class (except belonging class) can't touch private method and variable

2. default

   if u don't choose access modifier. u can access default modifier

3. protected

   like private. but u can touch with override

4. public

   everyone can access this modifier

**'static' has relationship with type** and java is static language

**'void' means this functions has no returns**
